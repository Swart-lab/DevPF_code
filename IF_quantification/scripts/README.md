# Protein localization and quantification with immunoflourescence

These scripts are written in marco for the useage in Fiji software.

### Fluorescence micropscopy imaging for localization
Execute scripts 1 - 4 to aquire .tiff images. To save all z-planes of a stack as individual images, execute script 5

### Protein quantification
Measure mean fluorescence intensities in a defined ROI with ovalROI-measure.ijm
